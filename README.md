  your bot needs that it can be get at the bottom of a this
  page https://discord.com/developers/applications/YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE/bot)

## How to set up

To set up the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.json](config.json) file where you can put the
needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable                  | What it is                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YOUR_BOT_PREFIX_HERE      | The prefix you want to use for normal commands                        |
| YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE       | The token of your bot                                                 |
| YOUR_BOT_PERMISSIONS_HERE | The permissions integer your bot needs when it gets invited           |
| YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE  | The application ID of your bot                                        |
| OWNERS                    | The user ID of all the bot owners                                     |

In the [blacklist](blacklist.json) file you now can add IDs (as integers) in the `ids` list.

## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows), or your Command Prompt (
Windows)
.

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have multiple versions of python installed (2.x and 3.x) then you will need to use the following command:

```
python3 bot.py
```

or eventually

```
python3.8 bot.py
```

If you have just installed python today, then you just need to use the following command:

```
python bot.py
```
